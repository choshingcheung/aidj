# AI DJ: Sequential Playlist Generation with Intelligent Track Transitions

**Course:** CSE 158/258 - Web Mining and Recommender Systems
**Assignment:** 2
**Dataset:** Spotify Million Playlist Dataset

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent DJ system that generates sequential playlists with smooth track transitions by combining:

1. **Sequential Recommendation (FPMC):** Predicts the next song given playlist history
2. **Transition Quality Assessment (XGBoost):** Learns musical compatibility between consecutive tracks
3. **Audio Generation (Spleeter):** Creates smooth crossfades based on learned transition quality

## Quick Setup

**Works on both Mac and Windows!**

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml

# Activate environment
conda activate aidj

# Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

**📖 For detailed setup instructions, see [SETUP.md](SETUP.md)**

This includes:
- Installing conda (if needed)
- Downloading Spotify dataset
- Setting up API credentials
- Platform-specific tips

## Predictive Tasks

### Task 1A: Next Track Prediction

**Input:** Playlist history $s_1, s_2, ..., s_t$
**Output:** Next song $s_{t+1}$
**Model:** Factorized Personalized Markov Chains (FPMC)
**Evaluation:** Hit@K, AUC

### Task 1B: Transition Quality Regression

**Input:** Audio features of consecutive tracks $(s_i, s_j)$
**Output:** Smoothness score $Q(s_i, s_j) \in [0, 1]$
**Model:** XGBoost Regression
**Evaluation:** MSE, MAE, R²

## Key Models

### 1. Factorized Personalized Markov Chains (FPMC)

Combines matrix factorization with Markov chains for sequential recommendation:

$$\hat{y}_{u,i,j} = \langle V_u^U, V_i^I \rangle + \langle V_j^{LI}, V_i^{IL} \rangle$$

- Captures both user preferences and sequential patterns
- Trained using Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR)

### 2. XGBoost Transition Quality Model

Learns compatibility function using 13 audio features:
- BPM difference
- Key distance (circle of fifths)
- Energy, valence, danceability differences
- Harmonic compatibility
- Mode matching
- And more...

### 3. Hybrid System

Combines FPMC + XGBoost for end-to-end playlist generation:

$$\text{score}(s_j | s_i) = \alpha \cdot P_{\text{seq}}(s_j | s_i) + \beta \cdot Q_{\text{trans}}(s_i, s_j)$$

### 4. Audio Mixing (Spleeter - Pretrained)

**Note:** We use Spleeter, a pretrained model by Deezer Research (Hennequin et al., 2020), for audio source separation. This is NOT our contribution—we only use it to demonstrate intelligent crossfading guided by our learned transition quality scores.

## Baselines

### Sequential Prediction:
- Random selection
- Popularity-based
- First-order Markov Chain

### Transition Quality:
- Mean baseline
- Linear regression

## Expected Results

- **Hit@10:** ~15-25% (vs. ~5% random baseline)
- **AUC:** ~0.75-0.85
- **Transition Quality R²:** ~0.6-0.7
- **Average Playlist Smoothness:** ~95% of human playlists

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2:** Data acquisition, preprocessing, EDA
- **Week 3-4:** Baseline models, FPMC implementation
- **Week 5-6:** XGBoost, hybrid system, audio demo
- **Week 7:** Presentation, polish, submission
